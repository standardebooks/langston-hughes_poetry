				<span>I've known rivers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.</span>

			<p>
				<span>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.</span>

				<span>Aunt Sue's stories.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And the dark-faced child, listening,</span>

				<span>Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows that Aunt Sue</span>

				<span>Never got her stories out of any book at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right out of her own life.</span>

				<span>And the dark-faced child is quiet</span>

				<span>We should have a land of sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gorgeous sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a land of fragrant water</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the twilight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a soft bandanna handkerchief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of rose and gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not this land where life is cold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We should have a land of trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of tall thick trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowed down with chattering parrots</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brilliant as the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not this land where birds are grey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, we should have a land of joy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of love and joy and wine and song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not this land where joy is wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh, sweet, away!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, my beloved one, away!</span>
