				<span>I've known rivers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.</span>

			<p>
				<span>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.</span>

				<span>Aunt Sue's stories.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And the dark-faced child, listening,</span>

				<span>Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows that Aunt Sue</span>

				<span>Never got her stories out of any book at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right out of her own life.</span>

				<span>And the dark-faced child is quiet</span>

				<span>And how you raise your churches from white suds for the service of the Holy God.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And I've seen you singing, wash-woman. Out in the backyard garden under the apple trees, singing, hanging white clothes on long lines in the sun-shine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I've seen you in church a Sunday morning singing, praising your Jesus, because some day you're going to sit on the right hand of the Son of God and forget you ever were a wash-woman. And the aching back and the bundles of clothes will be unremembered then.</span>
