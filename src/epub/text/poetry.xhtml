				<span>I've known rivers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I've known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow of human blood in human veins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the singing of the Mississippi when Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans, and I've seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I've known rivers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient, dusky rivers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My soul has grown deep like the rivers.</span>

				<span>Aunt Sue has a head full of stories.</span>

				<span>Aunt Sue has a whole heart full of stories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Summer nights on the front porch</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Working in the hot sun,</span>

				<span>Walking in the dewy night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And black slaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing sorrow songs on the banks of a mighty river</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingle themselves softly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the flow of old Aunt Sue's voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingle themselves softly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dark shadows that cross and recross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aunt Sue's stories.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the dark-faced child, listening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knows that Aunt Sue's stories are real stories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knows that Aunt Sue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never got her stories out of any book at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right out of her own life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the dark-faced child is quiet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a summer night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listening to Aunt Sue's stories.</span>
